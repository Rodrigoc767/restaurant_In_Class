/* 
    Write a program that computes the tax and tip on a restaurant bill for a patron. 

    1. Ask the user for the tax percent of tax and the gratuity percent they would like to give and assign it to the appropriate
        variable.

    2. Create a random number generator from 0-3 that will randomly select the meal cost.

    0 Salad: $9.95
    1 Soup: $4.55
    2 Sandwich: $13.25
    3 Pizza: $22.35

    3. I will assign the randomly generated number to an int.

    4. I will use an if else statement to determine the mathmatical equation and return and 
        print the total tip, tax, meal cost, and grand total
